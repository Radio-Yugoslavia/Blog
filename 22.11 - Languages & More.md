What I love the most about the Japanese is that they didn’t fall for the Web3 crap that plagues modern websites: micro-minimalist flat designs with huge javascript plug-ins for fancy effects that only give strain to your computer, fonts that aren’t rendered properly on any operating system, and bloat of stuff that nobody likes really. Web3 doesn’t exist, it’s only Web1 during the static era of the internet and Web 2.0 (Web2).

I’ve stumbled upon some wild YouTube videos about how the Japanese internet is special, and this is exactly the reason why. They kept their old-school Web2 designs and didn’t go for responsive gibberish, but went ahead and offered a special site for desktops and special one for mobiles. That’s what we’re doing as well.

We’re just re-organising, re-arranging, we’ve successfully managed to pull some old articles from the archive that we thought were gone forever, we added multiple languages (auto-translated, be warned!): Serbian, Croatian, Macedonian, Slovene, German, Russian, Japanese, Dutch for every article and page on our site.

Our blog is on GitHub which is probably not your usual place to host a blog, however, we’ve opened up an organisation there & we’re planning to publish lots of code. You can browse our Radio Yugoslavia GitHub, and especially take a look at the WordPress Snipets rep where you can block Israel and add Palestine to your WordPress e-commerce and ZionistFree repository where we add simple guidelines for blocking Israelis from accessing your servers via firewall.

Also very happy to say that we’ve got approved by Google for running their ad system for the first time, we’re running ads on our website for the first time since the creation back in 2011. We’re doing this to gather funds and all that we gather from the ads shown on our website will be donated towards Palestinian food banks. Because want to create this branch of open communication regarding everything we’re doing, on our Public Stats repository on GitHub you can follow the statistics of visitors - albiet not targeted to the point you’ll curse at us, but simply a rough number of both our website and the newsletter, which for October-November dateline printed almost 20K unique visitors to our website (insane!), and 3K views for our newsletter with the numbers rising. So, if you want to publish your ad on our platform feel free to contact us, we’ll literally donate every single cent we’re gonna make to Palestine food banks.

Either way, that’s it for this little update, from now on the blogs like these will be published on GitHub.
